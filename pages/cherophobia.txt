![Introduction]
Cherophobia is an aversion to happiness, a fear of happiness. In this song, I try to embody that feeling.

![Conclusion]
In the beginning, the song starts off in a joyous tone, but eventually gets to a fast-paced, anxious tone, representing the point where a cherophobic person wouldn't let themselves be happy. And if you really think about it, this word applies to everyone in a sense. Parents work tirelessly for survival, for the future of their kids, but never stop to wonder if they're happy. Kids go through the motions of life with no idea as to what's happening, until one day, they become the same as the parents. People look up to their idols, thinking they have it so much better. Yet the higher we go in the class system, the more sadness we see. We ask them to help us, when they can't help themselves. How can our idols save us if they can't even save themselves?
+
Everyone wishes they were a kid again, wanting to see their old friends, not wanting to leave their hometowns.
+
People will do anything for that nostalgia. Nostalgia, which they know, makes them despair for their future, miss their pass, and leave the present. They do it to themselves.
+
Cherophobia is an aversion to happiness. Cherophobia is a fear of happiness. Why?
+
Why do we allow our emotions to control us, and not the other way around?
+
There's no reason. And quite frankly, there's nothing stopping us from controlling our emotions.
+
Think about it. If you get in an argument with someone you love, you're angry at them. But you will still take care of them, you will still be there for them whenever they need you.
+
That's you controlling your emotions. If you didn't control them, you would've stopped loving them the moment you got angry at them.
+
But you continued to love them. Why? Because you wanted to.
+
So I implore you, whenever you find yourself running away from what makes you happy, living your life in a way you no longer want to, listen to this song.
+
And let it be a reminder to you that you are amazing. You are spectacular. You are loved. You deserve to be happy.
+
Let it be a reminder to you that you control your emotions.
+
But most importantly, let it be a reminder to you that you are strong.
+
Much stronger than you realize.
